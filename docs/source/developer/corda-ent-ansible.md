# Corda Enterprise Configurations

In the Blockchain Automation Framework project, Ansible is used to automate the certificate generation, putting them in vault and generate value files, which are then pushed to the git repository for deployment, using GitOps. This is achieved using Ansible playbooks. 
Ansible playbooks contains a series of roles and tasks which run in sequential order to achieve the automation.
For R3-Corda Enterprise, the ansible roles and playbooks are located at `platforms/r3-corda-ent/configuration/`
Some of the common roles and playbooks between Hyperledger-Fabric, Hyperledger-Indy, Hyperledger-Besu, R3 Corda and Quorum are located at `platforms/shared/configurations/`

--------
## Playbooks for setting up Corda Enterprise Network

Below are the playbooks availabe for the network operations.
## **deploy_network.yaml**
This is the main ansible playbook which call all the roles in below sequence to setup Corda Enterprise network.

* Remove build directory
* Create Storage Class
* Create namespace and vault auth
* Deploy CENM services
* Check that network service uri are reachable
* Deploy nodes

## **deploy_nodes.yaml**
This ansible playbook should be used when deploying only the nodes. This can be used when the CENM Services are already up and managed by a different network.yaml. This calls the below supporting roles in sequence.

* Remove build directory
* Create Storage Class
* Create namespace and vault auth
* Check that network service uri are reachable
* Deploy nodes

## **reset_network.yaml**
This ansible playbook is used when deleting the network. This calls the below supporting roles in sequence.

* Deletes the Gitops release files
* Deletes the Vault secrets and authpaths
* Uninstalls Flux
* Deletes the helm releases from Kubernetes
* Remove build directory
