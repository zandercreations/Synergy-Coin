# Quorum Configurations

In the Blockchain Automation Framework project, ansible is used to automate the certificate generation, putting them in vault and generate value files, which are then pushed to the repository for deployment, using GitOps. This is achieved using Ansible playbooks. 
Ansible playbooks contains a series of roles and tasks which run in sequential order to achieve the automation.

```
/quorum
|-- charts
|   |-- node_constellation
|   |-- node_tessera
|-- images
|-- configuration
|   |-- roles/
|   |-- samples/
|   |-- deploy-network.yaml
|-- releases
|   |-- dev/
|-- scripts
```

For Quorum, the ansible roles and playbooks are located at `/platforms/quorum/configuration/`
Some of the common roles and playbooks between Hyperledger-Fabric, Hyperledger-Indy, Hyperledger-Besu, R3 Corda and Quorum are located at `/platforms/shared/configurations/`
