### Folder Structure
```
/indy-auth-job
|-- templates
|   |-- job.yaml
|-- Chart.yaml
|-- values.yaml
```

### Charts description

#### templates
- This folder contains template structures which when combined with values, will generate valid Kubernetes manifest files for auth job implementation.
- This folder contains following template files for auth job implementation
	  
  - Job.yaml   

      This job uses admin auth to generate auth read only methods, policies and roles for stewards, so they have the right they need to work.

#### Chart.yaml

### Charts description

#### templates
- This folder contains template structures which, when combined with values, will generate Indy nodes.
- This folder contains following template files for instantiate_chaincode implementation
  - configmap.yaml   

      The configmap.yaml file through template engine generate configmaps. In Kubernetes, a ConfigMap is a container for storing configuration data. Things like pods can access the data in a ConfigMap. This file is used to inject Kubernetes container with indy config data.
  
  - service.yaml   

      This creates a service for indy node and indy node client. A service in Kubernetes is a grouping of pods that are running on the cluster

  - statesfulset.yaml   

    Statefulsets is used for Stateful applications, each repliCA of the pod will have its own state, and will be using its own Volume.
    This statefulset is used to create indy nodes.
          
#### Chart.yaml
- This file contains the information about the chart such as apiversion, appversion, name, etc.
#### values.yaml
- This file contains the default configuration values for the chart.
