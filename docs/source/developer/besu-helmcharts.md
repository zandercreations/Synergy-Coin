### Charts description

### templates
- This folder contains template structures which, when combined with values, will generate valid Kuberetenes manifest files for Hyperledger-Besu node implementation.
- This folder contains following template files for node implementation

  - _helpers.tpl   

      This file doesn't output a Kubernets manifest file as it begins with underscore (_). And it's a place to put template helpers that we can re-use throught the chart.
      That file is the default location for template partials, as we have defined a template to encapsulate a Kuberntes block label for node.

  - configmap.yaml   

      The configmap contains the genesis file data encoded in base64 format.

  - deployment.yaml   

      This file is used as a basic manifest for creating a Kubernetes deployment. For the node, this file creates a deployment. The file defines where containers are defined and the respective Hyperledger-Besu images. It also contain the initial containers where the crypto material is fetched from the vault.

  - service.yaml   

      This template is used as a basic manifest for creating service enpoints for our deployment.
      This service.yaml creates enpoints for the besu node.
