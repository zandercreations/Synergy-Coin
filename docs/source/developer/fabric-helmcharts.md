## Pre-requisites

``helm`` to be installed and configured on the cluster.

## CA (certification authority)

### About
This folder consists CA helm charts which are used by the ansible playbooks for the deployment of the CA component. The folder contains a templates folder, a chart file and a value file. 

### Folder Structure
```
/ca

### Charts description

#### templates
- This folder contains template structures which when combined with values, will generate valid Kubernetes manifest files for CA implementation.
- This folder contains following template files for CA implementation
  
  - _helpers.tpl   

      This file doesn't output a Kubernetes manifest file as it begins with underscore (_). And it's a place to put template helpers that we can re-use throughout the chart.
	  That file is the default location for template partials, as we have defined a template to encapsulate a Kubernetes block of labels for CA.
	  
  - deployment.yaml   

      This file is used as a basic manifest for creating a Kubernetes deployment. For the CA node, this file creates a CA deployment. The file defines where CA container is defined with fabric image and CA client and CA server onfiguration details and 
	  the init container basically configures the vault with various vault parameters. Certificates and CA server database are defined on the volume mount paths.
	  
  - service.yaml   

      This template is used as a basic manifest for creating a service endpoint for our deployment.
	  This service.yaml creates CA service endpoint. The file basically specifies service type and kind of service ports for the CA client and CA server.
	  
  - volume.yaml   

      This yaml is used to create persistent volumes claim for the CA deployment. A persistentVolumeClaim volume is used to mount a PersistentVolume into a Pod. 
	  PersistentVolumes provide a way for users to 'claim' durable storage  without having the information details of the particular cloud environment.
	  This file creates CA pvc for, the volume claim for CA.
            
#### Chart.yaml
- This file contains the information about the chart such as apiversion, appversion, name etc.
#### values.yaml
- This file contains the default configuration values for the chart.

  - volume.yaml   

      This yaml is used to create persistent volumes claim for the Orderer deployment. A persistentVolumeClaim volume is used to mount a PersistentVolume into a Pod. 
	  PersistentVolumes provide a way for users to 'claim' durable storage  without having the information details of the particular cloud environment.
	  This file creates two persistentVolumeClaims, one for CA tools pvc and the other to store crypto config in the ca-tools-crypto-pvc persistent volume.  
      
      
#### Chart.yaml
- This file contains the information about the chart such as apiversion, appversion, name etc.
#### values.yaml

### Charts description

#### templates
- This folder contains template structures which when combined with values, will generate valid Kubernetes manifest files for Peer implementation.
- This folder contains following template files for peer implementation
  - _helpers.tpl   

      This file doesn't output a Kubernetes manifest file as it begins with underscore (_). And it's a place to put template helpers that we can re-use throughout the chart.
	  That file is the default location for template partials, as we have defined a template to encapsulate a Kubernetes block of labels for channels.
  
  - configmap.yaml   

      The configmap.yaml file through template engine generate configmaps. In Kubernetes, a ConfigMap is a container for storing configuration data. Things like pods can access the data in a ConfigMap. 
	  The configmap.yaml file creates two configmaps namely genesis-block-peer and peer-config.
	  For Create_channel component, it creates two configmaps, one for the channel creation having various data fields such as channel, peer and orderer details, and another for the generation of channel artifacts containing the channel transaction (channeltx) block and other labels.
	   
  - create_channel.yaml   

      This file creates channel creation job where in the createchannel container the create channel peer commands are fired based on checking the results obtained from fetching channeltx block to see if channel has already been created or not.
	  Additionally, the commands are fired based on the tls status whether it is enabled or not. The init container is used to setup vault configurations, and certificates are obtained from the volume mount paths.
