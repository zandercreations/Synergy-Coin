# Configuration file specification: R3 Corda
A network.yaml file is the base configuration file for setting up a Corda DLT network. This file contains all the information related to the infrastructure and network specifications. Here is the structure of it.
![](./../_static/TopLevelClass-Corda.png)

Before setting up a Corda DLT/Blockchain network, this file needs to be updated with the required specifications.
A sample configuration file is provide in the repo path:  
`platforms/r3-corda/configuration/samples/network-cordav2.yaml`  

The configurations are grouped in the following sections for better understanding.

* type

* version

* frontend

* env

* docker

* network_services

* organizations

Here is the snapshot from the sample configuration file

![](./../_static/NetworkYamlCorda1.png)

The sections in the sample configuration file are  

`type` defines the platform choice like corda/fabric/quorum. Use `corda` for **Corda Opensource** and `corda-enterprise` for **Corda Enterprise**.

`version` defines the version of platform being used, here in example the Corda version is 4.0, the corda version 4.7 is supported by latest release. Please note only 4.4 above is supported for **Corda Enterprise**.

`frontend` is a flag which defines if frontend is enabled for nodes or not. Its value can only be enabled/disabled. This is only applicable if the sample Supplychain App is being installed.

`env` section contains the environment type and additional (other than 8443) Ambassador port configuration. Value for proxy field under this section has to be 'ambassador' as 'haproxy' has not been implemented for Corda.

The snapshot of the `env` section with example values is below
```yaml
  env:
    type: "env-type"                # tag for the environment. Important to run multiple flux on single cluster
    proxy: ambassador               # value has to be 'ambassador' as 'haproxy' has not been implemented for Corda
    ambassadorPorts:                # Any additional Ambassador ports can be given here, this is valid only if proxy='ambassador'
      portRange:              # For a range of ports 
        from: 15010 
        to: 15043
    # ports: 15020,15021      # For specific ports
    loadBalancerSourceRanges: # (Optional) Default value is '0.0.0.0/0', this value can be changed to any other IP adres or list (comma-separated without spaces) of IP adresses, this is valid only if proxy='ambassador'
    retry_count: 20                 # Retry count for the checks
    external_dns: enabled           # Should be enabled if using external-dns for automatic route configuration
```
The fields under `env` section are 

| Field      | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| type       | Environment type. Can be like dev/test/prod.|
| proxy      | Choice of the Cluster Ingress controller. Currently supports `ambassador` only as `haproxy` has not been implemented for Corda |
| ambassadorPorts   | Any additional Ambassador ports can be given here. This is only valid if `proxy: ambassador`     |
| loadBalancerSourceRanges | (Optional) Restrict inbound access to a single or list of IP adresses for the public Ambassador ports to enhance BAF network security. This is only valid if `proxy: ambassador`.  |
| retry_count       | Retry count for the checks. Use a large number if your kubernetes cluster is slow. |
| external_dns       | If the cluster has the external DNS service, this has to be set `enabled` so that the hosted zone is automatically updated. |


`docker` section contains the credentials of the repository where all the required images are built and stored.

For Opensource Corda, the required instructions are found [here](../architectureref/corda.html#docker-images).

For **Corda Enterprise**, all Docker images has to be built and stored in a private Docker registry before running the Ansible playbooks. The required instructions are found [here](../architectureref/corda-ent.html#docker-images).

The snapshot of the `docker` section with example values is below
```yaml
  # Docker registry details where images are stored. This will be used to create k8s secrets
  # Please ensure all required images are built and stored in this registry. 
  docker:
    url: "<url>"
    username: "<username>"
    password: "<password>"
```
The fields under `docker` section are

| Field      | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| url        | Docker registry url. Must be private registry for **Corda Enterprise**    | 
| username   | Username credential required for login      |
| password   | Password credential required for login      |

---
**NOTE:** Please follow [these instructions](../operations/configure_prerequisites.html#docker) to build and store the docker images before running the Ansible playbooks.

The snapshot of the `network_services` section with example values is below
```yaml
  # Remote connection information for doorman/idman and networkmap (will be blank or removed for hosting organization)
  network_services:
    - service:
      name: doorman
      type: doorman
      uri: https://doorman.test.corda.blockchaincloudpoc.com:8443
      certificate: home_dir/platforms/r3-corda/configuration/build/corda/doorman/tls/ambassador.crt
      crlissuer_subject: "CN=Corda TLS CRL Authority,OU=Corda UAT,O=R3 HoldCo LLC,L=New York,C=US"
    - service:
      name: networkmap
      type: networkmap
      uri: https://networkmap.test.corda.blockchaincloudpoc.com:8443
      certificate: home_dir/platforms/r3-corda/configuration/build/corda/networkmap/tls/ambassador.crt
      truststore: home_dir/platforms/r3-corda-ent/configuration/build/networkroottruststore.jks #Certificate should be encoded in base64 format
      truststore_pass: rootpassword
```
The `network_services` section contains a list of doorman/networkmap which is exposed to the network. Each `service` has the following fields:

| Field       | Description                                              |

The `organizations` section allows specification of one or many organizations that will be connecting to a network. If an organization is also hosting the root of the network (e.g. doorman, membership service, etc), then these services should be listed in this section as well.
In the sample example the 1st Organisation is hosting the root of the network, so the services doorman, nms and notary are listed under the 1st organization's service.

The snapshot of an organization field with sample values is below
```yaml
