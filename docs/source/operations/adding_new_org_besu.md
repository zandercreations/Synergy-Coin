# Adding a new node in Besu

  - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
  - [Create Configuration File](#create-configuration-file)
  - [Run playbook](#run-playbook)

<a name = "prerequisites"></a>
## Prerequisites
To add a new organization in Besu, an existing besu network should be running, enode information of all existing nodes present in the network should be available, genesis file should be available in base64 encoding and the information of orion nodes should be available and new node account should be unlocked prior adding the new node to the existing besu network. 

---
**NOTE**: Addition of a new organization has been tested on an existing network which is created by BAF. Networks created using other methods may be suitable but this has not been tested by BAF team.

---

**NOTE**: The guide is only for the addition of non-validator organization in existing besu network.

## Create Configuration File

Refer [this guide](./besu_networkyaml.md) for details on editing the configuration file.

The `network.yaml` file should contain the specific `network.organization` details along with the enode information, genesis file in base64 encoding and orion transaction manager details

---
**NOTE**: Make sure that the genesis flie is provided in base64 encoding. Also, if you are adding node to the same cluster as of another node, make sure that you add the ambassador ports of the existing node present in the cluster to the network.yaml

---
For reference, sample `network.yaml` file looks like below for IBFT consensus (but always check the latest network-besu-newnode.yaml at `platforms/hyperledger-besu/configuration/samples`):

```

# This is a sample configuration file for Hyperledger Besu network which has 4 nodes.
# All text values are case-sensitive
network:
  # Network level configuration specifies the attributes required for each organization
  # to join an existing network.
  type: besu
  version: 1.5.5  #this is the version of Besu docker image that will be deployed.

  #Environment section for Kubernetes setup
  env:
    type: "dev"              # tag for the environment. Important to run multiple flux on single cluster
    proxy: ambassador               # value has to be 'ambassador' as 'haproxy' has not been implemented for besu
    ## Any additional Ambassador ports can be given below, this is valid only if proxy='ambassador'
    #  These ports are enabled per cluster, so if you have multiple clusters you do not need so many ports
    #  This sample uses a single cluster, so we have to open 4 ports for each Node. These ports are again specified for each organization below
    ambassadorPorts:
      portRange:              # For a range of ports 
        from: 15010

## Run playbook

The [site.yaml](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-automation-framework/tree/master/platforms/shared/configuration/site.yaml) playbook is used to add a new organization to the existing network. This can be done using the following command

```
ansible-playbook platforms/shared/configuration/site.yaml --extra-vars "@path-to-network.yaml" --extra-vars "add_new_org=True"
```
