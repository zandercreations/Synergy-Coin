# Configuration file specification: Quorum
A network.yaml file is the base configuration file designed in the Blockchain Automation Framework for setting up a Quorum DLT network. This file contains all the configurations related to the network that has to be deployed. Below shows its structure.
![](./../_static/TopLevelClass-Quorum.png)

Before setting up a Quorum DLT/Blockchain network, this file needs to be updated with the required specifications.  

A sample configuration file is provided in the repo path:  
`platforms/quorum/configuration/samples/network-quorum.yaml` 

The configurations are grouped in the following sections for better understanding.

* type

* version

* env

* docker

* config

* organizations

Here is the snapshot from the sample configuration file

![](./../_static/NetworkYamlQuorum.png)

The sections in the sample configuration file are  

`type` defines the platform choice like corda/fabric/indy/quorum, here in the example its **quorum**.

`version` defines the version of platform being used. The current Quorum version support is only for **21.4.2**

---
**NOTE**: Use Quorum Version 21.4.2 if you are deploying Supplychain smartcontracts from examples.

---

`env` section contains the environment type and additional (other than 8443) Ambassador port configuration. Vaule for proxy field under this section can be 'ambassador' or 'haproxy'

The snapshot of the `env` section with example value is below
```yaml 
  env:
    type: "env-type"              # tag for the environment. Important to run multiple flux on single cluster
    proxy: ambassador               # value has to be 'ambassador' as 'haproxy' has not been implemented for Quorum
    #  These ports are enabled per cluster, so if you have multiple clusters you do not need so many ports
    #  This sample uses a single cluster, so we have to open 4 ports for each Node. These ports are again specified for each organization below
    ambassadorPorts:                # Any additional Ambassador ports can be given here, this is valid only if proxy='ambassador'
      portRange:              # For a range of ports 
        from: 15010 
        to: 15043
    # ports: 15020,15021      # For specific ports
    loadBalancerSourceRanges: 0.0.0.0/0 # Default value is '0.0.0.0/0', this value can be changed to any other IP adres or list (comma-separated without spaces) of IP adresses, this is valid only if proxy='ambassador'  
    retry_count: 50                # Retry count for the checks
    external_dns: enabled           # Should be enabled if using external-dns for automatic route configuration
```
The fields under `env` section are 

| Field      | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| type       | Environment type. Can be like dev/test/prod.|
| proxy      | Choice of the Cluster Ingress controller. Currently supports 'ambassador' only as 'haproxy' has not been implemented for Quorum |
| ambassadorPorts   | Any additional Ambassador ports can be given here. This is only valid if `proxy: ambassador`. These ports are enabled per cluster, so if you have multiple clusters you do not need so many ports to be opened on Ambassador. Our sample uses a single cluster, so we have to open 4 ports for each Node. These ports are again specified in the `organization` section.     |
| loadBalancerSourceRanges | Restrict inbound access to a single or list of IP adresses for the public Ambassador ports to enhance BAF network security. This is only valid if `proxy: ambassador`.  |
| retry_count       | Retry count for the checks. Use a high number if your cluster is slow. |
|external_dns       | If the cluster has the external DNS service, this has to be set `enabled` so that the hosted zone is automatically updated. |

`docker` section contains the credentials of the repository where all the required images are built and stored.

The snapshot of the `docker` section with example values is below
```yaml
  # Docker registry details where images are stored. This will be used to create k8s secrets
  # Please ensure all required images are built and stored in this registry.
  # Do not check-in docker_password.
  docker:
    url: "docker_url"
    username: "docker_username"
    password: "docker_password"
```
The fields under `docker` section are

| Field    | Description                            |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
| url      | Docker registry url                    |

The fields under `config` are

|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| consensus   | Currently supports `raft` or `ibft`. Please update the remaining items according to the consensus chosen as not all values are valid for both the consensus.                                 |
| subject     | This is the subject of the root CA which will be created for the Quorum network. The root CA is for development purposes only, production networks should already have the root certificates.   |

| tm_trust | Options are: `whitelist`, `ca-or-tofu`, `ca`, `tofu`. This is the trust relationships for the transaction managers. More details [for tessera]( https://github.com/jpmorganchase/tessera/wiki/TLS) and [for consellation](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/constellation/blob/master/sample.conf).|

| bootnode | This is only applicable when adding a new node to existing network and contains the boot node rpc details |


The `organizations` section contains the specifications of each organization.  

In the sample configuration example, we have four organization under the `organizations` section.

The snapshot of an organization field with sample values is below

    - organization:

      cloud_provider: aws   # Options: aws, azure, gcp, minikube
```
Each `organization` under the `organizations` section has the following fields. 

| Field                                    | Description                                 |
