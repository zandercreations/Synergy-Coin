# Adding a new organization in R3 Corda

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Create configuration file](#create_config_file)
- [Running playbook to deploy R3 Corda network](#run_network)

<a name = "prerequisites"></a>
## Prerequisites
To add a new organization Corda Doorman and Networkmap services should already be running. The public certificates from Doorman and Networkmap should be available and specified in the configuration file. 

---
**NOTE**: Addition of a new organization has been tested on an existing network which is created by BAF. Networks created using other methods may be suitable but this has not been tested by BAF team.

<a name = "create_config_file"></a>
## Create Configuration File

Refer [this guide](./corda_networkyaml.md) for details on editing the configuration file.

The `network.yaml` file should contain the specific `network.organization` details along with the network service information about the networkmap and doorman service.

---
**NOTE**: Make sure the doorman and networkmap service certificates are in plain text and not encoded in base64 or any other encoding scheme, along with correct paths to them mentioned in network.yaml.

---
For reference, sample `network.yaml` file looks like below (but always check the latest at `platforms/r3-corda/configuration/samples`):

```
network:
  # Network level configuration specifies the attributes required for each organization
  # to join an existing network.
  type: corda
  version: 4.0
  #enabled flag is frontend is enabled for nodes
  frontend: enabled
  
  #Environment section for Kubernetes setup

## Run playbook

The [add-new-organization.yaml](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-automation-framework/tree/master/platforms/shared/configuration/add-new-organization.yaml) playbook is used to add a new organization to the existing network. This can be done using the following command

```
ansible-playbook platforms/shared/configuration/add-new-organization.yaml --extra-vars "@path-to-network.yaml"
```

**NOTE:** If you have CorDapps and applications, please deploy them as well.
