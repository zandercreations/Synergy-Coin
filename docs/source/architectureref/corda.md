# Corda Opensource Architecture Reference

## Kubernetes
### Peer Nodes
The following diagram shows how Corda peer nodes will be deployed on your Kubernetes instance.

![Figure: R3 Corda Kubernetes Deployment - Peers](../_static/corda-kubernetes-node.png)

**Notes:**
1. Pods are shown in blue in the diagram.
1. Certificates are mounted as in-memory volumes from the [vault](#vault-config).
1. The node-pod runs corda.jar.
1. The h2 database is a separate pod running in the same namespace
1. All storage uses a Kubernetes Persistent Volume.

### Support Services
The following diagram shows how the Corda Support Services (**Doorman**, **Networkmap** and **Notary**) will be deployed on your Kubernetes instance.

![Figure: R3 Corda Kubernetes Deployment - Support Services](../_static/corda-support-services.png)

**Notes:**
1. Pods are shown in blue in the diagram.
1. Certificates are mounted as in-memory volumes from the [vault](#vault-config).
1. Doorman and Networkmap services have a separate MongoDB pod for data storage.
1. Notary service has a separate H2 pod for data storage.
1. All storage uses a Kubernetes Persistent Volume.

## Components

### Docker Images

The Blockchain Automation Framework creates/provides a set of Corda Docker images that can be found in the [Hyperledger-Labs repository](https://hub.docker.com/u/hyperledgerlabs) or can be built as per [configuring prerequisites](../operations/configure_prerequisites.md). 
The following Corda Docker Images are used and needed by the Blockchain Automation Framework.
* [Corda Network Map Service](https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledgerlabs/networkmap-linuxkit) 
* [Corda Doorman Service](https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledgerlabs/doorman-linuxkit)
* [Corda Node](https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledgerlabs/corda)

### Ansible Playbooks

Detailed information on ansible playbooks can be referred [here](../developer/corda-ansible) and the execution process can be referred [here](../operations/setting_dlt.md)

### Helm Charts

## Vault Configuration
The Blockchain Automation Framework stores their `crypto` and `credentials` immediately within the secret secrets engine.
Optionally, `secret_path` can be set on the network.yaml to change the secret engine from the default `secret/`.
| Crypto Material Path | Credentials Path     |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| `secret/<servicename>`      | `secret/<servicename>/credentials` |

*  `secrets/doorman/credentials/mongodb` - Contains password for doorman mongodb database.

```
mongodbPassword="admin"
```

*  `secrets/doorman/credentials/userpassword` - Contains password for doorman mongodb database user:

```
sa="newdbnm"
```
*  `secrets/networkmap/credentials/mongodb` - Contains password for networkmap mongodb database:

```
mongodbPassword="newdbnm"
```
*  `secrets/networkmap/credentials/userpassword` - Contains password for networkmap mongodb database user:
