## Manually creating images ##

### Alpine Utils ###

Alpine-utils docker image is a light-weight utility image used in BAF. It is mainly used as init-containers in BAF Kubernetes deployments to connect to Hashicorp Vault to download certificates.

1. To build the image, execute the following command from this folder. 
```
	sudo docker build -t alpine-utils:1.0 -f alpine-utils.Dockerfile .

```
2. The above command will create an image with tag *alpine-utils:1.0*. If you want to upload this image to a registry, update the tag accordingly and then push to docker. Sample command below:
```
	sudo docker tag alpine-utils:1.0 hyperledgerlabs/alpine-utils:1.0
	sudo docker push hyperledgerlabs/alpine-utils:1.0
```

### Ansible Slave ###

Ansible-slave docker image is used for Jenkins Slave configuration. This image can be used to run BAF Ansible commands on Jenkins without the need to install Ansible on the Jenkins master.

1. To build the image, execute the following command from this folder. 
```
	sudo docker build -t ansible-slave:1.0 -f ansibleSlave.Dockerfile .

```
2. The above command will create an image with tag *ansible-slave:1.0*. If you want to upload this image to a registry, update the tag accordingly and then push to docker. Sample command below:
```
	sudo docker tag ansible-slave:1.0 hyperledgerlabs/ansible-slave:1.0
	sudo docker push hyperledgerlabs/ansible-slave:1.0
```

**NOTE:** Depending on your Jenkins configuration, the Docker repo may have to be public for Jenkins to download this image.
